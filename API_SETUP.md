# Smart Webcam Assistant - API Setup (Backend Proxy Architecture)

This application uses an **industry-standard backend proxy architecture** for maximum security and API key management.

## üîí Secure Backend Proxy Architecture

**Maximum Security & Control** - Your API keys are encrypted and stored securely on our backend.

### Benefits
- **üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise security** - API keys encrypted and stored in secure database
- **üí∞ Individual cost control** - Each user manages their own API keys and billing
- **üìä Usage transparency** - Monitor usage through your API dashboards
- **üöÄ Optimized performance** - Backend caching and request optimization
- **üîê Zero client risk** - API keys never exist in browser or frontend code
- **üë• Multi-user support** - Individual accounts with isolated API key storage

### How It Works
1. **Create an account** - Register for secure access to the application
2. **Configure your keys** - Enter API keys once, stored encrypted in database
3. **Backend proxy** - All API calls made securely from our backend
4. **Session management** - Secure authentication with Laravel sessions

## üìä API Key Management

### Adding/Updating Keys
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Manage API Keys ‚Üí Enter keys ‚Üí Save
```
- Keys are validated before saving
- Previous keys are securely overwritten
- Changes take effect immediately

### Testing Keys
```
API Keys Panel ‚Üí Test Keys button
```
- Validates connectivity to OpenAI and ElevenLabs
- Tests actual API endpoints
- Shows detailed error messages if issues exist

### Monitoring Usage
- **Last used timestamps** - See when keys were last accessed
- **API dashboard links** - Direct links to OpenAI/ElevenLabs usage
- **Status indicators** - Visual confirmation of key configuration

### Removing Keys
```
API Keys Panel ‚Üí Clear Keys button
```
- Permanently deletes encrypted keys from database
- Requires confirmation
- Takes effect immediately

## üîß API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register     - Create new user account
POST /api/auth/login        - Login with email/password
POST /api/auth/logout       - Secure logout
GET  /api/auth/user         - Get current user info
GET  /api/auth/check        - Check authentication status
```

### API Key Management (Protected)
```
POST   /api/api-keys         - Store/update encrypted API keys
GET    /api/api-keys/status  - Get key configuration status
POST   /api/api-keys/validate - Validate stored keys
DELETE /api/api-keys         - Delete stored keys
```

### Image Processing (Protected)
```
POST /api/process-image-proxy - Process image with user's encrypted keys
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### With User API Keys
- **Direct billing** to your OpenAI/ElevenLabs accounts
- **Full cost control** and transparency
- **Usage monitoring** in your API dashboards
- **Set your own limits** and budgets
- **No markup** - pay API providers directly

### Usage Estimation
- **Image analysis** - ~$0.01-0.03 per image (depending on model)
- **Speech generation** - ~$0.10-0.30 per audio minute
- **Total cost** - Typically $0.11-0.33 per processed image with audio

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Missing API Keys" Error
- **Solution**: Configure both OpenAI and ElevenLabs keys
- **Check**: API Keys panel shows both services as "Configured"

#### "Authentication Required" Error
- **Solution**: Login to your account
- **Check**: Dashboard shows your name and email

#### "API Key Invalid" Error
- **Solution**: Verify keys in your API provider dashboards
- **Check**: Use "Test Keys" button to validate connectivity

#### "Processing Failed" Error
- **Solution**: Check API key limits and billing status
- **Check**: Review error messages for specific issues

### Performance Issues
- **Slow processing** - Try GPT-4o Mini model for faster responses
- **Audio generation fails** - Verify ElevenLabs account has sufficient credits
- **Connection timeouts** - Check internet connection and API service status

## üìã Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords** for account registration
2. **Monitor API usage** in OpenAI/ElevenLabs dashboards
3. **Set usage limits** in your API accounts
4. **Keep API keys private** - never share with others
5. **Log out** when using shared computers

### For Organizations
1. **Individual accounts** - Each user should have their own account
2. **Key rotation** - Periodically update API keys
3. **Usage monitoring** - Review API costs and usage patterns
4. **Access control** - Ensure only authorized users have accounts
